# Contact List

## Features

> The current version is static. Future updates will allow for adding/removing/updating contacts, and viewing a contact on its own page.

* The search bar filters by either first or last name, email address, or phone number.

* Each contact in the list consists of:
  - An avatar
  - First and last name
  - Phone number
  - Email address
  - A nonfunctional "chat" icon

* An "Add Contact" icon in the top-right allows to add a new contact. (This is not yet implemented.)
